                Light blue, curly hair is pulled back to reveal a long, sad face. Shuttered sapphire eyes, set appealingly within their sockets,
                watch thoughtfully over the river they've shown mercy on for so long. Fair skin gracefully compliments his
                nose and leaves an intriguing memory of his past. This is the face of Almer Dawnwhisper, a true opportunist
                among high elves. He stands towering above others, despite his tough frame. There's something alluring about
                him, perhaps it's his odd friends or perhaps it's simply his good will. But nonetheless, people tend to try
                to get him to marry their off-spring, while trying to please him.

                Silver, perfectly groomed hair slightly covers a thin, worried face. Bulging amber eyes, set narrowly within their sockets,
                watch anxiously over the woods they've sworn to protect for so long. Freckles are spread charmingly around
                his nose and cheekbones and leaves a gracious memory of his reckless luck. This is the face of Alred Lunadancer,
                a true sentinel among night elves. He stands seductively among others, despite his muscled frame. There's
                something intriguing about him, perhaps it's his decency or perhaps it's simply his bravery. But nonetheless,
                people tend to share local gossip with him, while secretly dispising him.

                Ginger, short hair hangs over a thin, lively face. Glittering gray eyes, set lightly within their sockets, watch loyally
                over the homes they've felt disconnected from for so long. A goatee delightfully compliments his nose and
                leaves a delightful memory of his upbringing. This is the face of Adan Gedney, a true visionary among humans.
                He stands seductively among others, despite his lean frame. There's something different about him, perhaps
                it's his suffering or perhaps it's simply his sense of honor. But nonetheless, people tend to try to get
                him to marry their off-spring, while learning as much about him as possible.

                Silver, curly hair tight in a ponytail reveals a thin, frowning face. Expressive amber eyes, set rooted within their sockets,
                watch vigilantly over the palace they've been isolated from for so long. A gunshot left a mark reaching from
                the right side of the forehead , running towards the tip of the nose and ending under his right eye leaves
                a beautiful memory of defended homes. This is the face of Alluin Dawnwing, a true utopian among blood elves.
                He stands alluringly among others, despite his big frame. There's something obscure about him, perhaps it's
                his company or perhaps it's simply a feeling of arogance. But nonetheless, people tend to buy him a drink,
                while hoping to one day follow in his footsteps.
